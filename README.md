# SVD-application
The idea is to use SVD as a dimensionality reduction tool, and construct a nearest neighbour classifier in this new space. 

Our dataset is a collection of high-quality images of faces of a groups of people (with repetitions). The resulting classifier will assign a new, unseen photo to a person.

Our main learning objective is to understand this lower-dimensional represention given by SVD.

This assignment is guided less tightly than the previous two assignents. With the information from the past lectures you should be able to complete it.
